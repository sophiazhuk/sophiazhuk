                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>
                    Hi, my name is Sophia. I am Computer Science student at Western Washington University. My goal with this website is to practice web development and log stuff for fun.</p>
                  </br>
                    <h1>Website History</h1>
                    <p>This is the second iteration of this website. The first prototype was ugly and poorly structured(using tables...) so I restarted with what I learned(flex boxes). </br></br>
                    This website is inspired by early internet's simple web design. I used early 2000's web templates as reference but using newer web dev techniques.</br></br>
                    Honestly, I was inspired to make this website after finding Paul Nylander's <a href="https://bugman123.com/"><u>bugman123.com</u></a> website. I found his website after searching for cool pictures of fractals and hyperbolic art.
                  </p>
                  <h1>Interests</h1>
                  <p>
                    I took an AP Comp Sci class in highschool which grew my interest in coding. I continued to take CS classes in community college and then a UX Design class. To be honest, I like the design/frontend aspect of development rather than back end, data structures, algorithm, blah blah. But, I still have to learn it for my Computer Science major.</br> </br>
          
                    I also enjoy photography. I have a side hustle of real estate photography and occasionally portraits. I also enjoy film photography. I have too many cameras. </br> </br>
          
                    Also, in my free time, I enjoy playing video games. My favorite games are the Half Life series, Portal series, Mass Effect 2, and of course Minecraft.
                  </p>
