                    <p>
                        In school, we used to do socratic seminar debates which I hated because I suck at talking. I learned later that the socratic seminar is named after the Greek philosopher, Socrates, who believed in speaking rather than in writing. He thought that "writing was not an effective means of communicating knowledge". The reason he thought this, was because he believed that people were becoming dumber from writing assisting their thought.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I reflect on this surge of AI in the past couple of years, I find the philosophical dilemma Socrates thought of thousands of years ago to be relevant on this topic. Especially with language models like ChatGPT which broke into the mainstream. As a student, I see many of my peers using it to complete their homework, write essays, and even read for them. Of course, I do find myself using it too. It's fairly new and schools have taught us to write a certain way, so it goes unnoticed by many.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also look to past technologies to see how they affected society to this extent. For example, when Google was launched, people quickly adapted to searching things up at an instant. It became a mundane tool that everyone uses and it is okay. I wonder if language models and similar will have the same outcome.
